I agree with you that this is a potential security risk, but for an attacker it would be quite an investment to deploy a successful MitM attack in order to obtain potentially sensitive vulnerability information. The time window to exploit the obtained information is extremely limited, since the bug has been disclosed to a security team that'll likely fix it soon. Low attack ROI. Also, if you are being MitM'd, I can think of way more interesting things to go after. \n\nWe hear you though and I appreciate your efforts explaining the risks involved, but it's not something we're going to address right now. We have planned PGP support, but it's not at the top of our roadmap at this time. ",
