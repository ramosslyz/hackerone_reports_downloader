Don't use the password reset link.\r\n3) Login using the same password back and update your email address to \"efgh@x.com\" and verify the same.\r\n4) Now logout and use the password reset link which was mailed to \"abcd@x.com\" in step 2.\r\n5) You can see that it is possible to change the password.\r\nHere  the password reset link of \"abcd@x.com\" which was old email address associated with twitter can be use to change the password of twitter account having  updated email address \"efgh@x.com\".\r\n\r\nAttack scenario:\r\nIf victim's previous \"abcd@x.com\" account was compromised, he decided to updated his twitter email address to \"efgh@x.com\" but before updating by mistake he asked for password reset link. As a result his twitter account will be compromised by the attacker.\r\n\r\nFix: As soon as new email address is updated all the previous links should also get expired.\r\n\r\nIf you want further information please let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks and regards.\r\nMohd Haji",

I do agree that u have given time-based expiration. But here scenario is different.\nHere attacker can easily change the password of new email address associated with twitter before link is getting expired with the help of link generated by your server to old email address.\nAs a result twitter account  will account be compromised.\nPlease have a look at it again.\nI strongly suggest you that once an email address is updated at twitter then password reset link generated by your server to old email address  should get expire. An attacker needs hardly of 5 to 10 minutes to change the password, till that time link won't be expiring.",
