    "vulnerability_information": "**Summary:**\n\nHi Team,\n\nHackerOne is very sensitive when it comes to HackerOne report data such as `report title`,`severity`,`program` etc. H1 will not share those private data base on the HackerOne privacy policy.\n\nRecently, HackerOne disclosed this report #1540969 [Race condition in joining CTF group](https://hackerone.com/reports/1540969) submitted by @zeyu2001 but the video PoC by the researcher was not redacted, the video contains undisclosed report reported by @zeyu2001 to other program like __██████__ and __███__ , this is both mistak by the researcher and HackerOne.\n\nResearcher leak his own undisclosed report to PoC which is not related the #1540969 , and HackerOne did not redacted it before disclosure, resulting in disclosing sensitive information like `report title`.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Go to this fully disclosed report: https://hackerone.com/reports/1540969\n2. Check this comment when report participant named @osman1337 completed the retest: https://hackerone.com/reports/1540969#activity-16794287\n3. Observed that there is video PoC named `poc-h1.mp4`\n4. Watch the video PoC carefully and 3 undisclosed reports unrelated to the submission was leaked on the video poc.\n5. See screenshot below for my proof\n\n█████████\n\n__The screenshot was taken from the video PoC, I can directly comment that the below undisclosed report was leaked__\n\nReport ID: #1570556 \nReport Title: ████\nSeverity: Medium\nReported to: ████ (I believe this program is private because I can't see that in public directory)\n\nReport ID: #1576582 \nReport Title: ██████████\nSeverity: Medium\nReported to: ███████\n\nReport ID: #1576582 \nReport Title: ██████\nSeverity: High\nReported to: ████\n\n## Impact\n\nSensitive report data leak such as report title, severity. program, report id.\n\nThis is a clear violation of HackerOne data privacy for customers.\n\n## Mitigation:\n\nAlways review sensitive information before full disclosure to not disclosed other report data that was unrelated to the submission.\n\nLet me know if you need more information.\n\nRegards\n@syjane",
