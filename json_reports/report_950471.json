    "vulnerability_information": "Description:  Issue in the zomato android application is that the user account can be deleted without confirming user password or re authentication.\n The removal of account is one of the sensitive part of any application that needs to protect, therefore removing an account should validate the authenticity of the legitimate user. \n\nSteps To Reproduce:\n1. Login through google authentication in the Zomato android application. \n\n2. Do some modification like change user name, add user address etc.\n\n3. Go to account settings and click on delete account. Give any reason for deletion and click next..\n\n4. There will next page where click on delete my account now option. \n\nRemediation:\nSystem must confirm authentic user before performing such task. A link can be send to user email id that can be used for delete operation. Otherwise user password should be provided to application to confirm the entity identity.\n\n\n\nPOC Video Link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1645NnultPzEIvR1rPwBRFOOeV234U9mV/view?usp=sharing\n\n## Impact\n\nIt seems to be of very low impact,but consider a situation when user forget to logout from his account or someone get access to his phone and delete the account. This situation is more severe than account takeover as there is no way to get account again. All the save information and data including previous record, card information etc will be deleted.\n\nC: Low\nI:   Medium\nA: High",

            "message": "Thanks █████████  for considering it again. Please look this from another prospective. \n\nZomato is not only a food delivery app, it's an emotions for all food lover and blogger. People use this to write review, add photos, following other food lovers. Additionally for each review you will get some points. You can consider this as social networking site for food love similarly like fb and instagram.\n\nNow coming to attacking scenario:\n\nConsider yourself a food lover, who writes review for each place where you go. Add review, comments over others review. Also you like to add photos.\n\nYou are doing this for many years and now you are reputed food blogger and food lover in this community. You also check in statics in zomato application.\n\nNow what if some one get your mobile phone, or may be you have given your phone to your friend for ordering food.\nAnd accidentally or deliberately he deleted your account. And it's so easy he don't need to verify to zomato that delete call is originated form you or real user.\nNow, all the reviews, points, picture, everything got deleted. This is not only about user data it's about years of hard work. \n\nHope you understand my concern, I am attaching video POC for all process.--\nStep 1:- In video you can see, I login from testcybrot@gmail.com account. And under user profile I have set my name profile picture, food review, people I am following, Dineline etc. And my level points.   Please note other user can also see and follow me, they check my comment. I this account is of any well known food blogger then, the restaurant review and pics also helps others.\nReputation is also one fact here to consider. \n\nStep2:- Delete this account. \n\nStep 3:- Again login using same email address i.e testcybrot@gmail.com\n\nStep4: Now check all the followers, dineline, my review comments even my points all have been deleted permanently. In short all my handwork gone for ever.  \n\nPotential risk : In this scenario we can confirm, once a user is deleted all his record and pointers got deleted. So might me same user can use one time coupon again and again by delete and re signup his account.\n\n\nConsider this situation under information risk. And must be there some mitigating controls to address this risk.  Hacking is also protecting ourselves. Consider here some defensive mechanism for data loss. Also take reference from other applications, you will not find any reputed application that has a function of user deletion without re-authenticate user identity. ",

Authorized user can also click on the delete account button by mistake or may be suppose he lost his phone and some one finds his phone he can simply delete his account which ultimately can leads to  account loss. \n\nMy concern is not for login authentication. My concern here is that account deletion is not a think that can be done by just a click. For such request application should re authenticate user as per secure design principles.  I agree this case could not be a thing to concern if user account does not linked with user activity. Here account is linked with my comments, reviews, pictures, points, rewards everything and once it got deleted, there is no way to get all these data sets. Yes I agree you can again re-login and create account but what about if data sets. Also if you login using email issue can be same.\n\nHope you get my point, and I requested for publish because this thing might be useful for others, I respect you decision here might be this is not a security issue for zomato to consider but same issue I have reported for different application and they considered it. \n\nThis is an information security issue.\n\n\nRegards,\nAman ",

Please check my attached POC video.\n\nBackground: I have created an account using my email id. And made some dummy data set like profile picture, review, name change some followers etc. To check if I create account using same email should I get all the commit data sets again? \n\nThen, I delete my account using same process. \nThis time also application does not ask me to re authenticate again to before deleting my account. \n\nAfter deletion, I created account again using same email id. And after looking over the account I can confirm all the information, data, review, pictures points, rewards...everything has been deleted.\n\nImpact:  \n\nRegardless mode of any login procedure(email or third party login) account deletion request does not require user to re validate his identity.\n\nRisk : Availability and Data loss\n\n> User accidentally click on delete button.\n> Someone who got your phone can click on delete button intentionally which can leads to account delete. As no one usually logout from application after the use.\n> Consider, in both the case if user use zomato as an social networking place for food lover where he writes review, share pictures, earn rewards, follow others people and other also follow users all these information can be lost.\n\nHope you consider this issue as an risk to user information loss.\n\nAs per your advice, I have attached video of this process and this time i am using email login process.
