    "vulnerability_information": "## Summary:\nA vulnerability has been found in \"inDriver Job\", an application located at https://injob.indriver.com/, a platform that allows employers to **publish job offers** and candidates to sign up for them. It seems like the application has **heavy use**, with a plethora of job offers in many categories.\n\nIn the app, anyone can request to **create job offers**, but, to prevent spam, scamming and phishing, every job offer creation and edit **has to be approved by a site admin** before being published. This is essential, since it prevents the app from getting **flooded with scammers**.\n\nThe vulnerability discovered allows an attacker to **completely bypass** this approval step, allowing the publishing of arbitrary content.\n\n## Technical Details:\nOn the last step of the job offer creation, the application makes a final `POST` request to `/api/graphql`, calling for `UpdateVacancyStatus`.\n\n```\n{\"operationName\":\"UpdateVacancyStatus\",\"variables\":{\"vacancyId\":\"█████\",\"status\":\"MODERATION\"}\n...\n```\nRe-sending this request, but modifying the **\"status\" variable to \"ACTIVE\"**, bypasses the need for a moderator approval, **publishing the ad**.\n\n## Video POC\n██████████\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n*Note for Triager: A phone number is required for signup. To skip this step, I've attached my session cookies. Using these, you could reproduce the steps noted below.*\n\n(Please see video for in-depth demo)\n  1. In employer mode, create a new job offer\n  2. Fill in the required fields\n  3. After the creation, the offer will appear as \"Pending Approval\"\n  4. In Burp Proxy, send the last \"UpdateVacancyStatus\" request to Repeater, modifying \"status\":\"ACTIVE\"\n  5. The arbitrary ad will now show up as \"Active\", it will have been verified and published. All users will be able to see it.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can use this vulnerability to upload arbitrary content, for **scamming**, **malware** or even **advertising** purposes.\nIt is also possible to **flood the platform** with infinite offers, making it unusable for legitimate users.",

This promo code gives you an additional ==$133.7*== payout for each payout vulnerability.\n\nThe promotion is only available for payout vulnerabilities, so you'll need to follow these steps and meet the following requirements to take advantage of the promo code:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Report the vulnerability **during the promotion period** through the HackerOne platform as usual.\n2. Leave the following text in the description or in the comment in the report: `Promo code: happy_birthday_indrive10`.\n3. As usual your report is verified by our team, is confirmed as a valid one, and is entitled to payout in accordance with our Bounty Program. \n4. Get the payout for the report.\n5. Be awarded an additional promo payout.\n\n**Important rules to  be mentioned:**\n--------------------------------------\n1. If you have submitted the report before the start of the promotion period, no additional payout can proceed. Retrieving the report and submitting it again will cause no effect as it will be recognized as a duplicate one.\n2. If you submit the report during the promotion period without leaving a Promo code in the report/comment, you may still leave a comment before the payout. We’ll do our best to take it into account and increase the payment if the payout has not yet been proceeded.\n3. inDrive reserves its right not to award with the additional payout in case the promo misuse is identified, e.g., leaving a comment into reports submitted before the start of the promotion period. \n\nWe hope this promo code bonus allows you to feel our sincere gratitude for your work and support.\n\nIf you have any questions or need more information about the promotion, feel free to contact us.\n\n***\\* - The total amount of payment by promo code will be $134 since HackerOne has a restriction in the form of rounding the amount to a whole number***\n\nBest wishes,\n\nInDrive Security Team.\n{F2415448}",
