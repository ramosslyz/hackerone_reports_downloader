    "vulnerability_information": "https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/pull/4771 added support for \"local edit\", this feature is however implemented in an insecure way.\n\n[The code](https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/blob/ee98244877e8ccaaa8487f2487c31ce112b746c5/src/gui/folderman.cpp#L1476-L1480) is calling into `QDesktopServices::openUrl(QUrl::fromLocalFile(foundFiles.first()));` and `foundFiled.first()` will be the path of the file specified via the deeplink:\n\n```cpp\n    // In case the VFS mode is enabled and a file is not yet hydrated, we must call QDesktopServices::openUrl from a separate thread, or, there will be a freeze.\n    // To avoid searching for a specific folder and checking if the VFS is enabled - we just always call it from a separate thread.\n    QtConcurrent::run([foundFiles] {\n        QDesktopServices::openUrl(QUrl::fromLocalFile(foundFiles.first()));\n    });\n```\n\n`QDesktopServices::openUrl` is however not suited for not trusted user input as it will also execute files directly.\n\n## Proof of concept\n\nThe following proof of concept was performed under Windows 10:\n\n1. In the web interface create a `test.vbs` file such as `MsgBox \"Hallo\", VBOKOnly, \"Ok\"`.\n2. Open `nc://open/mSnmByRJcj6cwKwX@demo1.nextcloud.com/test.vbs` in the browser (adjust username and instance path)\n3. The VB Script will be executed and a popup will appear.\n\n**Note:** This can also be exploited by a remote attacker if they upload a file to the same instance a user has access to.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nThere are several mitigation recommendations here:\n\n- Add a CSRF token to the `nc://open/` link and have the client verify the token on request.\n- Ensure only safe file types can be opened using a local file viewer. \n\n## Disclosure Policy\nPlease note that all bugs reported by [Authentick GmbH](https://www.authentick.net) will be publicly disclosed within 90 days of vendor notification. In extraordinary cases we may increase that upon request by the vendor.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe Nextcloud Desktop Client in version 3.6.0 is vulnerable to a Remote Code Execution that can be exploited by anyone that is able to upload files to an instance the user has access to. **In many cases this will be everyone due to public chats, files drop upload, etc.**\n\nExploitation just requires the victim to visit a malicious web page (or click a link on an email or anything like that)",

(using any off the shelf antivirus evasion tool)\n\n> it is \"only\" a convenient shortcut to open a file instead of doing it manually: navigating to folder and double-click it\n\nThis small shortcut allows however someone else to open potentially malicious binaries that the attacker has uploaded using any of the means mentioned earlier.\n\n> limiting it to \"valid\" filetypes is hard/impossible, as pdf, docx, svg, etc all can be malicious too\n\nThose file types won't execute anything automatically and any code execution requires additional user action.
