    "vulnerability_information": "The `antispambot` function escapes some randomly selected characters from its first argument, for example:\n\n```\n<?php\necho antispambot( 'example@example.com' );\n```\n\nThis would print out:\n\n```\nexa&#109;p&#108;&#101;&#64;&#101;xa&#109;pl&#101;&#46;&#99;o&#109;\n```\n\nSince this returns HTML, developers are not going to use `esc_html` with the return value of `antispambot`, since that would double-escape the result. Developers will assume that this function can be safely used with untrusted email addresses, which is a fair assumption. However, it turns out that `antispambot` cannot be trusted. Whether a character is escaped is randomly selected, even if the character is `<`, `>`, `&`, `\"`, or `'`. These last five characters should always be escaped.\n\nThere is a chance that this will print out unescaped:\n\n```\n<?php\necho antispambot( '<script>console.log(\"hello\");</script>');\n```\n\nEven though the chance of this happening is low, with enough repetitions this could happen eventually.\n\n`antispambot` should always escape the five sensitive characters.\n\n## Impact\n\nIf `antispambot` is being used by a plugin that passes to it untrusted input, an attacker could cause arbitrary client-side code to run. Since the probability of all of the characters remaining unescaped is low, only a small fraction of the attacks would succeed, and the attacker would need the ability to attack many times to see a few successes.",

I ran it about 5 times and it usually took between 1 and 8 minutes, with about `2.75 million` tests per minute.\n\nThinking through the details, it seems like it's extremely unlikely that this would be successfully used in a real world attack.\n\nWhen Core displays comment authors in wp-admin, it escapes the address with `esc_url()`, and I don't think there are many themes that display the email address on the front-end, in order to protect privacy.\n\nEven if a plugin or theme did display the address unescaped, the victim would still need to visit a page showing the comment, which seems very unlikely if there are millions of comments to navigate through. At that point it's also likely that the attacker would be stopped by other means (Akismet, the site owner disabling comments out of frustration, etc).\n\nGiven all the mitigating factors, I think this can probably be considered a low-priority hardening enhancement, and worked on publicly on core.trac.wordpress.org.\n\nBefore we do that, though, I wanted to get your thoughts, in case I'm missing something. Do the mitigating factors above seem correct to you? Can you think of any way to significantly increase the likelihood of success?\n\nI'll ask another member of the security team to take a look at this before we move it to Core Trac as well, just to be safe.\n",
