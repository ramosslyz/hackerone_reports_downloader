    "vulnerability_information": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI found another bug on hackerone.\r\nThis time it is very dangerous and creative.\r\nHope you will definitely love it.\r\n\r\nAny valid account on hackerone can be hacked. eg Co-founders @jobert and @michiel can also be hacked.\r\nI tried this one on my account only.\r\n\r\nLets go to the point ...\r\n\r\nThings required to takeover complete account :\r\n========================================\r\n1. Valid email-id which is registered on hackerone.\r\n\r\nNow, chaining from my previously i.e lately reported bugs.\r\nUser enumeration attack I reported recently.\r\n\r\nOne can find a registered email easily. eg michiel@hackerone.com or jobert@hackerone.com\r\n\r\nBasic Idea :\r\n==========\r\n1. I am requesting a 'Reset Password link' to user's email. \r\neg.\r\nhttps://hackerone.com/users/password/edit?reset_password_token=MUm2xQ_TEtf2RaG1H3DK\r\n\r\n2. Guessing the reset_password_token i.e reset_password_token=MUm2xQ_TEtf2RaG1H3DK\r\n\r\nAs everyone replying my bug reports know that there is no BRUTE FORCE protection. I am doing the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nProof of concept :\r\n================\r\n1. Generate a 'Reset Password link' of user whose account is to be compromised/hacked.\r\n2. Use a burp suite and configure it to do a Brute Force Attack on token\r\neg. https://hackerone.com/users/password/edit?reset_password_token=MUm2xQ_TEtf2RaG1H3DK\r\n\r\nNow, it is very easy to identify valid reset_password_tokens.\r\n\r\nServer Status 200 ---> valid\r\nServer Status 302 ----> invalid\r\n\r\nlength 4378 --->valid\r\nlength 1525 --->invalid\r\n\r\n3. Try resetting password now.\r\n4. Login with email and password.\r\n\r\nSpecial Note :\r\n===========\r\nAttacker doing a brute force will get all valid tokens which are requested by user and are valid.\r\nSo attacker can reset password of users.\r\n\r\nThis was all from me. Hope now you understand the severity and power of Brute Force.\r\nI am attaching a screenshot POC to show that there is no protection from server side as mentioned by @michiel and @jobert to me recently about brute force.\r\n\r\nJust I made attack on my account. To show it I am attaching a screen shot. \r\nAnd there is really no protection from hackerone server. I have already made few thousands request and I am eagerly waiting for something to block me from server side.\r\n\r\nHope you quickly get back to me. :)\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nPranav",

The problem with brute forcing these kind of tokens is that it is not very likely you'll actually hit an unused password reset token. The password reset tokens expire after 6 hours and cannot be guessed easily (as far as I know, the tokens are not predictable). Also, we have a number of systems monitoring for unusual amount of traffic to our app servers (but you knew that already :)). Just to make sure: did you find a way to predict the tokens besides brute force? Thanks!",

But, because of the 6 hour time window, it's not a realistic attack scenario.\n\n> I know the hash is 20 letters long and requires about 2,14,74,83,647 guesses. This may take several days.\n\nBrute forcing a password reset token will take years, not several days. Looking at the time window a password reset token is valid, this is (again) not realistic. If you like, check out [this code](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/d56641f514f54da04f778b2a9b816561df7910c2/lib/devise/token_generator.rb). That's the class we use for generating password reset and confirmation tokens.\n\n> But why aren't any measures against Brute Force are implemented on hackerone?\n\nBecause none of the attacks are realistic. In theory they would work, but so far we have never seen a realistic attack scenario regarding tokens we use (password reset, confirmations, invitations).\n\n> What about creating a fake account and guessing the confirmation token? \n\nThe only theoretical impact is that you can confirm a user account that has an email address you don't actually own. I don't see any other implications and doubt that it's an actual security bug. Am I missing something?\n\n> How can you say I requested a password Reset link for your account?\n\nPlease read my comment again, because I didn't say that. I never had someone else request a password reset for my account. Since you mentioned it in your initial submission, it's possible you triggered it (even by accident). Just making sure we're at the same page about the rules of our bug bounty program.",

Yes, we should be as secure as possible, but the impact of a security vulnerability can vary based upon a combination of:\n\n- The type of user that's being targeted\n- The impact of the vulnerability\n\nThis can make it that we as HackerOne, decide not to fix certain reports that other companies might have fixed.\n \n> As I can find a valid email-id which is registered on hackerone and request as many links I want.\n> Here, user's email inbox will be spammed. \n> You would not like to lose a User or A Team which is registered on hackerone due to spamming.\n\nI personally don't think that we will lose users, in case this ever happens. Our users know that we're a security oriented site, and although we really don't like to bother our users with stuff like this, I think that they will have enough understanding of the situation to not leave our site. Even more so because we would ban the spammer as soon as we'd detect an attack.\n\n> I know you will now understand the severity of this bug. I want you to fix this bug on 'Reset Password Page'.\n\nWe still consider this bug a won't fix. I hope that I was able to convince you of our stance on this matter. I think that some of these low-priority bugs might get fixed in a more distant future, but for now we're focussing on getting the product even more awesome ;-). I hope you understand.\n\n> I hope you will understand what I wanted to say this time.\n\nThanks for the excellent explanation! It really helped me understand the point that you're trying to make. Though I would like to ask you if you could file separate bugs for things like these. Your original report was called \"Account takeover\", but it turned into \"Ability to spam members of HackerOne\", which is a totally different report in my opinion. You maybe could've even replied on the already closed \"User Enumeration\" report.\n\nWe handle all reports with care, so there is no need to worry that we won't reply to you if you create another report for another bug!\n\nThanks again for the explanation, and thanks for the effort you put in helping us improve our security!\n\nRemon",
