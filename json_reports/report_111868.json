I think I then pasted it into the information box and went to another couple of pages. When I returned, the information was in both the title and information boxes. I figure there may be a cookie saving my prepopulated values so I can come back to an unfinished report but it was odd that code I submitted to a Shopify form showed up on Hackerone....\n\nI thought this might be a browser thing so I logged out of my Google account on Chrome and still saw the issue. Then I opened up IE and logged into Hackerone and saw the issue.\n\nPerhaps unrelated, but figure I'll include it in case it helps, when I was using Burb Suite to intercept Shopify form submissions, I also noticed some requests to Hackerone but didn't really pay attention to them at the time...\n\nAnyways, hope this isn't a total waste of your time.",

I can confirm that while we do save drafts for a smoother UX, there is no leaking between report forms that I discovered.\n\nIn this case, you can self-close the report as N/A. This way, you don't take any negative reputation hit or signal loss. We thank you for updating with your findings.\n\nHappy Hacking!\nFern :)",

While I'm not killing it now, still continue to submit reports which get closed as Informative, often go through a dry spell of finding no vulnerabilities, I'd like to think since this submission, I'm improving and have provided value to HackerOne, Shopify, Twitter, MoneyBird, DrChrono, Veris and other private programs.\n\nYou can probably guess reading my submission, I was clueless to the fact that HackerOne made POST calls to auto save submissions. I also have the OWASP XSS link open in my screenshot and am testing trying to make HackerOne send unintended emails. I'm also not sure why I searched \"get browser to execute JS\". Pretty indicative of my skill level at the time.\n\nI hope this helps others realize we all have to start somewhere. I, no doubt, have contributed to bug bounty noise. Ben Sadeghipour, Patrik Fehrenbach, Philippe Harewood and Adam Bacchus are great examples of an alternative means to reducing noise - each took the time from their schedules to sit down and teach me, and other new hackers who watch the interviews, how to improve. Additionally, all the hackers who disclose reports or publish detailed write ups should also be acknowledged as helping build the collective hacker community but the list would be too long to include here.",
