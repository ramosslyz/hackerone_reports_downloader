    "vulnerability_information": "Hi HackerOne,\n\n**Summary:**\n\nI have found a way that it is possible to harvest all private invitation using the new __Leave Program__ feature together with the `security@` email forwarding feature __without any user interaction__.\n\n---\n\n**Description:**\n\nFirst, when the program activated the `security@` email forwarding on hackerone and the hacker sent an email to `security@company.com` which is activated, hackerone system will send an invite to hackers and this invite will allow hackerone to become a participants of private program.\n\nNow, hackers can choose to leave to the program in __exchange__ of another automated invite when the hackers filled-up the leave program survey form using the new __Leave Program__ functionality. (see image below)\n\n{F282541}\n\n\n---\n### Now how to exploit it ? , very easy.. hackerone will do it for you fully automated without any user interaction\n---\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nAssumes that you don't have any invites (as in 0 invites)\n\n  1. First step you have to find program with `security@` email forwarding enabled on hackerone, this is easy just go to https://hackerone.com/bug-bounty-programs, click all the program and send a test email to their declared `security at` email on their public page, if you received a response to submit your bug, then that means `security@` is activated in hackerone.  \n███████\n\n  2. Lets take `███████`, send a test mail to that address\n  3. You will received an invitation email via `security@` email forwarding feature.\n  4. Click the __Submit Vulnerability__ , you are now a participants.\n  5. Now leave the program and fill-up the leave survey then confirm leave.\n  7. You'll be fast-tracked for invites, invitation will come most likely arriving in the next 24 hours as stated.\n  8. __REPEAT STEP 2 to 7__ after getting a new invite came from fast-tracked invites.\n\n__NOTE:__ Ask more information if you are having trouble understanding my submission.__\n\nBut this is easy to exploit, just send an email to: `██████ > get invites > leave to ██████████ > get new invites came from fast-tracked > repeat`\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can harvest all private invitation without any user interaction, in a matter of few months you can have 100+ private invitation by just daily repeating the steps i provided above.\n\n__INVITES ALL YOU CAN__\n\nLet me know if you need more information.\n\nCheers\nJapz",

You were not the first and we did our jobs to figure out what was going on. Even if we would've found the vulnerability internally, we would've closed it as a duplicate. I don't understand why it's so difficult for you to accept that it's a duplicate. You found something great, but it was known to us. \n\n> Have a great day ahead, I would like to request a full disclosure of my report.\n\nFeel free to blog about this report once the original report has been resolved and disclosed. We almost never disclose duplicate reports and I don't see a good reason why we should disclose this. I'm getting the sense that you want to disclose this to have others comment on this that you're in the right. I'm fine with some people not agreeing with this, but it's going to be a difficult conversation without the correct context.\n\nLet me point out that HackerOne has absolutely no incentive to screw over the hackers who report to our program. I'd rather pay more than pay less. However, we're not going to pay for duplicates, regardless of who found it, at this point. The ONLY exception we have is that someone points out that they reported something earlier and we awarded a later report. However, that's our fault and exactly why we'd pay for it.\n\nGood luck,\n\nJobert",
