    "vulnerability_information": "Hello,\r\n\r\nThis bug is a design flaw in the reputation system.\r\n\r\nSimply, when a bug is resolved `+7`  is added to the user's account. When bounty is awarded then the reputation points are calculated based on standard deviation from the program's mean.\r\n\r\nI found these here ---> <https://hackerone.com/news/introducing-reputation>\r\n>You gain reputation when:\r\nYour report is Closed as Resolved: +7\r\nYour report is Closed as Duplicate (Resolved): +2. Only applied if reported before the original was closed.\r\nYou are awarded a bounty. The amount is based on standard deviation from the program's mean:\r\n+50: $ >= µ + 1σ\r\n+25: $ >  µ\r\n+15: $ >= µ - 1σ\r\n+10: $ <  µ - 1σ\r\nYour report is Closed as Won't Fix: +1\r\nYour report is Closed as Duplicate (Won't Fix): +1\r\n\r\n>You lose reputation when:\r\nYour report is Closed as Not Applicable: -5\r\nYour report is Closed as Duplicate (Not Applicable): -5\r\nYour report is updated as Needs more info: -1\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Now, one reporter can earn max of `+50` reputation points if award is far maximum than program's min bounty amount.\r\n2. Also, when report is marked as `Resolved` then `+7` are added.\r\n3. So, totally max of `+57` points can be made from a single bug report.\r\n\r\nBut there exists a flaw which will allow to boost reputation points more than `+57`. \r\n1.  A report is awarded bounty of `$350` but minimum bounty of program is `$100`. So, this adds `+50` reputation points to the reporter.\r\n2. Now, report is marked resolved, so `+7` reputation points are added.\r\n3. Now, if same report is awarded with bounty `$150`, then it will again add `+15`.\r\n\r\nSo, if a report is rewarded again and again then it will boost reputation points more than default `+57`. So, this totally contradicts the policy mentioned here ---> <https://hackerone.com/news/introducing-reputation>\r\nDue to this flaw, reporter will earn more reputation points more than other researchers.\r\ni.e If researcher two reports a severe bug then he will get `+50` and `+7`. Total of `+57`. (Total bounty 1000$)\r\nBut at the 1st researcher's report is being rewarded again and again. It will boost as `+50` and `+7` and again awarded so `+15`. Total `+72`.(Total bounty 350$ + 150$ = 500$)\r\n\r\nI hope you understand the severity here and modify the reputation system accordingly. I found this bug on my own account. So, I am attaching an image poc of my account. Sensitive information has been forged. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nPranav",

Deep reports a RCE on hackerone. Deep is rewarded `$5000`. Deep will get `+57` (+50 and +7 resolved).\n2. Pranav reports an OR(open redirector) on hackerone. Pranav gets `$1000` as reward.\n Consider, Pranav gets `+57` (+50 and +7 resolved).\nNow, hackerone decides to reward more to the bug as they found something more severe. So, additional `$500` bounty is paid. It will again increase `+15`.\n\n*So, totally, Pranav will end up in earning `+72`. And Deep earned only `+57` for an RCE on hackerone.\nThis is certainly not expected by other researchers.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>Teams are trusted, and we assume they do not consciously abuse the reputation system.\n\nHere, why are you considering only teams? What about researchers?\nYou are having a personal perspective from team's side and not from the researchers. Let me explain your business model.\n\nHackerOne takes `20%` of bounty awarded by any program. \neg. `RelateIq` rewards researcher Pranav for his bug report with `100$` bounty then `HackerOne` earns `20$` i.e `20%` from that.\n\nSo, HackerOne should always keep in mind that without researchers they are nothing.\nIf researchers don't submit any valid bugs to programs then hackerOne will not earn anything. And the motive `On a mission to make internet a safer place` will go insane.\n\nApart, coming back to ordinary researcher's perspective.  `Reputation System` is used to maintain ranks and points system. So, based on that some private invites to researchers are fired.\neg. Researcher with rank 1, i.e Fran's will get private invites first.\n\nNow, what is the point in making a `Reputation System`? if it is not loyal and some flaws like I pointed lies in it?\nDeep is reporting RCE and earning `+57` but Pranav is reporting OR and earning `+72` because hackerone decided to reward once more to Pranav.\nThis is simply, cheating with Deep.\n\nThis behavior on the researcher's side will greatly affect one's rank. So, if you are creating `Reputation System` and classifying them according to their ranks and points then it should be flawless.\n\nI hope you get my points and work on it rather than closing it as `N/A` without much thinking about the whole. :-)\n\nRegards,\nPranav",

Given that to exploit this for additional reputation would take social engineering to convince teams to break up single bounties into multiple bounties, and that there are legitimate cases where teams decide that a bug is worth an additional and significant bounty (and reputation should be allocated accordingly), we're going to close this as won't fix. \n\nThat being said, the bounty awarding and reputation allocation process is one that we are continually reexamining and thinking about from new directions, so we appreciate your contribution to this discussion.\n\nHappy Hacking!\n\n\nEvan",
