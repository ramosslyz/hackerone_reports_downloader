This is the fixed that reported in #38343. \n\nHowever, it defeats the fix in #38343 because when a password changed in `password reset links` for `disabled/inactive user` does not receive notification via email containing that password was recently changed.\n\n__POC__ \nhttps://vimeo.com/214135835\npassword: protection",

That was mentioned by @jobert that this don't need an immediate security resolution that's why the issue stayed for a year/month(s).\n\nIf you would reason out that this shouldn't closed as `Resolved` because the new policy which happened in `May 4th (3 years ago)` that you have mentioned in the report #209140, then I would also reason out that this report is also a duplicate of report #208638. Which I think  this #208638 or #279914 is also worth to mark as `Resolved`.\n\nAs you can see the issue also happened in #209140 because the security team did not `Responded` to the comment I have responded.
