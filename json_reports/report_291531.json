    "vulnerability_information": "**Summary:**\nInterospection query leaks sensitive data.\n\n**Introduction**\nAs we know graphql was initially developed and used by facebook as an **internal query language** and so the features of graphql mostly revolve around internal and development areas.\nGraphql executes queries using a type system with the data defined. An important but often ignored feature of graphql is the ability to ask graphql schema about the supported queries with the help of **Interospection Sytem**\n\n**Description (includes Impact and Steps to Reproduce)**\nAn interospection system can completely reveal the backend system defined by developers inluding arguments,fields,types,descriptions,deprecated status of types and so on. \nThis could easily give out the complete map of backend system along with the schema and directives. \n\nIn our case graphql is implemented as an [endpoint] (https://hackerone.com/graphql) to retrieve sensitive data like user information, payout preferences, program policies, team settings etc.\nRevealing the schema of the entire backend will serve as an attack ground for attackers in order to craft graphql queries that can retrieve fields that are normally not meant to be accessed by users.\nMoreover any changes made or to be brought about can be easily revealed through **description** fields of types.\n\nThe following graphql query is an **interospection query** that completely reveals the defined system with all required details ([Reference] (https://gist.github.com/craigbeck/b90915d49fda19d5b2b17ead14dcd6da)). \n\n`{\"query\": \"query IntrospectionQuery {__schema {queryType { name },mutationType { name },subscriptionType { name },types {...FullType},directives {name,description,args {...InputValue},onOperation,onFragment,onField}}}\\nfragment FullType on __Type {kind,name,description,fields(includeDeprecated: true) {name,description,args {...InputValue},type {...TypeRef},isDeprecated,deprecationReason},inputFields {...InputValue},interfaces {...TypeRef},enumValues(includeDeprecated: true) {name,description,isDeprecated,deprecationReason},possibleTypes {...TypeRef}}\\nfragment InputValue on __InputValue {name,description,type { ...TypeRef },defaultValue}\\nfragment TypeRef on __Type {kind,name,ofType {kind,name,ofType {kind,name,ofType {kind,name}}}}\"}`\n\nUpon looking into the response (ie the graphql system map returned), following things were observed:\n\n+ **Deprecated Nodes could still be queried at root level**\n\nThe interospection query response returned deprecated status of nodes like \"Report\",\"Team\" as \"true\":\n\neg.\n> \"isDeprecated\": true,\n  \"deprecationReason\": \"Query for a <Node Name> node at the root level is not recommended. Ref T12456\" \n\nBut it was seen that a graphql query could still be created with above nodes as root. \n\neg. Query with Node **Team** at root level:\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**\n\n`{\"query\": \"query {team(handle:\\\"security\\\"){id,_id,about,base_bounty,bug_count}}\"}`\n\nThis returned valid data even if it was supposed to be deprecated:\n\n> {\n\t\"data\": {\n\t\t\"team\": {\n\t\t\t\"id\": \"Z2lkOi8vaGFja2Vyb25lL1RlYW0vMTM=\",\n\t\t\t\"_id\": \"13\",\n\t\t\t\"about\": \"Vulnerability disclosure should be safe, transparent, and rewarding.\",\n\t\t\t\"base_bounty\": 500,\n\t\t\t\"bug_count\": 236\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nThis holds true for all nodes that shouldnt be allowed to query directly at root level: Report, Team, User.\n\n**Impact**\nNode queries not meant to be allowed at root level could still be executed and could potentially leak data not to be retrieved otherwise. \n\n\n+ **Additional Fields of Nodes can be disclosed**\n\nThe fields that are not retrieved normally could be retrieved due to knowledge of all fields on a type (or OBJECT). \n\neg. the fields sla_missed_count sla_failed-count for a team:\n\n**Steps to Reproduce** \n`{\"query\": \"query {team(handle:\\\"security\\\"){sla_failed_count,sla_missed_count}}\"}`\n\n> {\n\t\"data\": {\n\t\t\"team\": {\n\t\t\t\"sla_failed_count\": 0,\n\t\t\t\"sla_missed_count\": 0\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nThis was also possible due to \"team\" being allowed at root level.\n\n**Impact**\nDisclosure of additional fields on Nodes\n\n\n+ **Description field leaks future implementations**\n\n> \"deprecationReason\": \"This is about to be replaced by .genius_execution\" \n> \"deprecationReason\": \"Deprecated in favor of .original_report\" \n\nThese were returned as deprecationReason fields for genius_execution_id and original_report_id respectively. \n\n**Impact**\nMay leak future implementations\n\n\n**Possible fix**\nAs mentioned before, graphql was originally used as internal query language and so features like \"Interospection System\" was useful for development.\nBut When it is used as a method to query sensitive data, it becomes a threat. Interospection queries should be disabled.\n\n\nRegards,\nZuriel",

Since you request any query to it, it's pretty important that we have this adequately secured. \n\nWe don't agree with the security impact of your findings. Let me address them one by one/\n\nIntrospection is not something limited to internal use, quite the opposite; it's super useful for external implementers to know how your API/domain works. We even encourage you to use it to make recognizance less of a hassle. The idea is that it makes your hacker life easier and therefore our product more secure.\n\nWe're okay with exposing disabled users. For example, you still want to see the reporter's details of an old report filed by a user that's now blocked. To support this, we have to allow you to query blocked users.\n\nNext one, database id. We're, again, entirely okay exposing the database id. There's just no security risk when exposing this number.\n\nThanks,\n\nWillian",

I discovered that the **first_response_time** field was being leaked some days ago while I was digging graphql. Now the first_response_time of a team is normally not returned during any of the responses querying a team information. I came to know that this field exists and is leaking the values only because of the introspection query.\n\nSee @wvdv, I am not trying to prove that the introspection system itself is a bug. But if not taken care there might be situations like above mentioned where accidently one could leak fields that are not meant to be revealed. Fortunately it was fixed at the time of drafting a previous report and now it returns null, and so i chose not to report it. I wouldnt have known about it at all, if i had not queried and known that such a field exists on node team. \n\nSo inshort I am just trying to say that, when things are open to users, there are higher chances of a bug being visible, which otherwise would go un-noticed. The scope for an attack is increased. Hope you get my point.\n\nTo end it I would like you to confirm the following things too, just to make sure they are intentional too:\n1) Graphql query response returns rank of all users although it is denoted by *-* (hiphen) on the profile.\n2) Cluster category information and external program id of teams are also returned. {F241240}\n3) Total count of teams, users and reports.\n\nThank you @wvdv for the information and courtesy. :) ",
