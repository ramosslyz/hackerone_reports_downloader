An attacker can cause connection failures and they can trigger the use of TLS 1.0 to exploit vulnerabilities like BEAST.\nWebsites using TLS 1.0 will be considered non-compliant by PCI after 30 June 2018.\n\nImpact: Attackers can perform man-in-the-middle attacks and observe the encryption traffic between your website and its visitors.\n\nRecommended Fix: Configure your web server to disallow using weak ciphers. You need to restart the web server to enable changes.\n\nBy fingerprinting server, found that its Nginx Web server. So below is solution for Nginx\nFor Nginx, locate any use of the directive ssl_protocols in the nginx.conf file and remove TLSv1.\nssl_protocols TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;\n",

[Their Director Of Security (jacobian) posted a nice response on Gratipay's repository about BEAST mitigation on Heroku](https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com/issues/1460).\n\nRegarding SSLLabs, you are allowed to run this tool against our servers, since the noise generate is nearly null. The sentence about automated scans in our policy is more to avoid getting copied and pasted Acunetix reports (same with w3af, etcâ€¦). \n\n[As SSLLabs explain](https://blog.qualys.com/ssllabs/2013/09/10/is-beast-still-a-threat), the fix for BEAST is client-side and no good server-side fix exists (except enabling only RC4), thus they don't consider it's a real risk anymore. It's still enabled when using Mozilla's \"Intermediate profile\" too.\n\nI'm closing this report as \"Informative\" since no direct security risk is present. Thanks for your report @yodha!",
