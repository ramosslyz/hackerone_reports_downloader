It could be used to execute some js actions by contructing content that uses the pre-existing attached event handlers (for example, `onclick`), but I am not sure how far could that go — I have not reviewed that, the mentioned issues are already pretty bad.\n\nThis could be used to make some issue/merge request pages inaccessible, to forge page content and potentially forge or hide other users comments in the thread.\n\n## PoC 1 — full-size message\nDemo: https://gitlab.com/ChALkeR/my-private-test-project/issues/2\n```html\n<pre class=\"zen-backdrop fullscreen sherlock-line-samples-table center\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://about.gitlab.com/images/press/logo/wm_no_bg.svg\" width=\"500\">\n<h2>Hello there! Something has gone wrong, we are working on it.</h2>\n<h3>In the meantime, play a game with us at <a href=\"http://example.com/\">example.com</a>.</h3>\n</pre>\n```\n\n## PoC 2 — basic JavaScript\n\nDemo: https://gitlab.com/ChALkeR/my-private-test-project/issues/3\n```html\n<pre class=\"js-details-expand\">click me</pre>\n<pre class=\"js-details-content hide\">foo</pre>\n```\n\nThere is a significant amout of onlick event listeners that are bound using just the classname, so it is possible to do some basic stuff with just classes and might be possible to execute more complex actions.\n\nI have not reviewed all instances in the JS where the classnames are used, that is irrelevant to fixing this issue.\n\n## Suggested fix\nBoth of the following should be applied:\n * Filter `class` attributes (higher priority).\n * Make sure that user content couldn't be displayed outside of the bounding box, e.g. by applying `oveflow:hidden` (lower priority).",

There at least one more project that is more popular than **redacted** there.\n> They are planning to do a release on Wednesday, April 5th.\n> Please hold off disclosing the issue until that date.\n> On the other hand, their release will disclose the issue (in their project, but the issue is shared between several projects, including **redacted**), so it would be best to prepare a release by then and to perform a coordinated release on Wednesday, April 5th.\n> If that is impossible, then note that any date after April 5th will be ok and there would be no more need for you to hold off disclosure anymore.\n\nThis is the best thing that I could do IMO in this course of action, though.\n\nNote that all of them are also open-source and also provide detailed information, so they are in the same position as you. On the other hand, they are either less popular or less affected than GitLab.\n\nNikita.",
