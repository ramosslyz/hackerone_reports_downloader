    "vulnerability_information": "**Description:**\nDue to lack of password protection and Insufficient Session Expiration I am able to brute force Adobe Connect meeting rooms. Many of the meeting rooms have chat history and files uploaded. Some of the chat history and files contains personal identifiable information.\n\nWalkthrough Section:\n\n1. To confirmed this vulnerability by first navigating to https://████\n\n█████████\n\n2. I then guessed a meeting room name such as ███████ 'https://████/████████'. The meeting requests a meeting ID which is proceed to test test\n\n█████████\n\n3. Then click on 'open in your browser'\n\n██████\n\n███\n\n4. You are now in. Which is expected on normal occasions.. However... if you begin to notice.. These rooms are not expiring properly..\n\n██████████\n\n███\n\n██████████\n\n██████\n\n5. Since the scale of meetings was large, i only selected a handful of meetings to search through which i provided chat logs and files. Also i have brute forced a total of 300+ meeting rooms. Some were locked some were open. I've provided a naming convention for the chat logs ███████.txt.\n\nThe handful:\n\nMeeting with Certificates\nhttps://███████/████████?proto=true\n\nMeeting Personal Information\nhttps://███████/███?proto=true\n\nMeeting with Phone number ████\nhttps://████/██████?proto=true\n\nMeeting with interesting topic '██████'\nhttps://███████/██████████?proto=true\n\nMeeting with personal ██████████'\nhttps://█████████/███████?proto=true\n\nMeeting with phone number ██████████\nhttps://████/███?proto=true\n\nMeeting with '█████████'\nhttps://███████/█████?proto=true\n\nMeeting with '██████████'\nhttps://█████/████████?proto=true\n\nNot sure if the presented data is test data or real data.\nhttps://█████████/███████\n\nMeeting with '███████  Code: █████████ ████████  Code: ████#'\nhttps://█████/███?proto=true\n\nMeeting with '███'\nhttps://██████████/████████?proto=true\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can use this information for malicious intentions such as blackmailing, phishing/spear phishing. This vulnerability puts military staff at risk.\n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n\nFor steps on reproducing please follow the walkthrough section above.\n\n## Product, Version, and Configuration (If applicable)\nAdobe Connect\n\nhttps://███████/version.txt\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\n\nIf you have a SIEM that ingests adobe connect logs you may need to review the connections to check for any potential unauthorized access.\n\nEnforce a setting in which all Adobe Connect users are forced to apply a meeting password might be the best option. This will also avoid people from invading into meetings such as teams and zoom bombings.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can use this information for malicious intentions such as blackmailing, phishing/spear phishing. This vulnerability puts military staff at risk.",
