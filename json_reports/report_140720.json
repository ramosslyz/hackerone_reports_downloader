    "vulnerability_information": "Hello Team!\nFirst of all thank you for acknowledging my feature request, I know it will help a lot of users.\n\nDescription:\n==========\nI just wanted to report a potential vulnerability on the report view functionality.\nFor obvious reasons I'm using my sandboxed team on an alternate account to test it, but I'm pretty sure it can be still exploited on non-sandboxed teams.\nI'm guessing that one of the main differences between sandboxed and non-sandboxed teams is that non-sandboxed have rate-limiting, but this wouldn't be a successfuly way of preventing this potential attack, but just a way of slowing it down, but not for long.\n\nBasically the problem relies in that the view report functionality, tries to load every comment, either man made or system made, which, given enough comments, overloads the server and sends a 524 Origin Time-Out.\n\nI was able to get this error by sending around 450 \"test\" messages on the same report, or by sending a few big messages. You can see it by yourself on reports 137508, 132450 and 138662 (Three different ways of exploiting this vulnerability)\n\nWhy is this a vulnerability?\n======================\nA malicious individual could very well leverage this vulnerability to prevent a legitimate user from accessing the report. In addition, it causes an unnecessary load on Hackerone's servers, since it can be used as a request amplification attack, by issuing a large amount of requests to the report, once it's filled with random info. Also, even though compression techniques can be used to reduce the amount of data transferred, this can by greatly bypassed by issuing high-entropy data (random), which would hinder the compression mechanisms.\n\nHow to fix this?\n=============\nSeveral ideas come to mind:\n- Limit the amount of consecutive comments that can be seen at once in a report, providing a \"see more\" button which will at most overload the client interface, not the server.\n- Limit the amount of data sent per comment, providing a \"see more\" button which loads the following chunk of data.\n- When a high amount of comment load is detected (either because of a high amount of comments or big comments being sent), perform a CAPTCHA check.\n\nAs you can see on the following screenshot, the report failed to load: {F95556}\n\nThis is the request made by the Ajax controller: {F95557}\n\nThis is the response sent by the server, showing a gateway error after 60 seconds: {F95558}",

Please hear me out and consider the following scenarios:\n- A disgruntled team member and/or bug bounty program member that wants to deny access to legitimate reports. This is something we often see in web applications that allow multiple access to certain objects of the application. Distrupting the access to legitimate users would cause a serious problem for the program and it would also cause a high load on your support channel.\n- A researcher that created a report and wants to prevent access to it by other people. Considering we can add comments to publicly disclosed reports, we could prevent someone from accessing them.\n\nAlso, this is not the first time a fix/bounty has been issued for a vulnerability that prevents someone from seeing a report. Check this out:\n- https://hackerone.com/reports/59369\n- https://hackerone.com/reports/115205\n- https://hackerone.com/reports/38232\n\nThose are three reports that talk about denial of service attacks by users that already have access to them.",

Here's a little more elaboration on why we're not treating this as a security issue.\n1) Protecting against rogue users with legitimate access harming their own content is generally beyond the purview of our bug bounty program. Therein lies madness. \n2) As you mentioned, worst case here is that the non-malicious users contact our support channel when they can't load the report, and then we fix it for them. This doesn't hide the report, it just makes its content unavailable.\n3) A researcher hiding a publicly disclosed bug totally sucks, but again falls more under the category of functional bug than security risk.\n\nIn regards to the reports you linked for precedent, I knew about them, and admittedly that bothered me. This kinda bug is pretty close to the threshold of a legit vulnerability and even though we try really _really_ hard to be consistent, having different engineers coming on and off security duty means inevitable quirks like this. To make sure that doesn't happen again I started a larger conversation with the team, and the firm consensus was that this is a purely functional issue and we should stick to that going forwards. The second part of that is that we also have something of a trend of resolving and even rewarding the first report of a functional bug (even if we don't fix it immediately), so thankfully we've been even more consistent about not resolving reports of this nature in recent months. \n\nI hope that makes sense, and just let me know if you have any more questions.\n\nThanks!\n\n\nEvan \n",
