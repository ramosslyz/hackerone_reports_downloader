    "vulnerability_information": "Hi Team,\n\nFound vulnerability of clickjacking on the domain \"aspen.io\".\n\nPlease refer the below attached screenshot as POC.\n\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Clickjack test page</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n<p>Website is vulnerable to clickjacking!</p>\n<iframe src=\"http://django.aspen.io/en/latest/\" height=\"500\"></iframe>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n2.save it as <anyname>.html eg cj.html\n3.and just simply open that in browser\n\nIssue Details :Clickjacking (User Interface redress attack, UI redress attack, UI redressing) is a malicious technique of tricking a Web user into clicking on something different from what the user perceives they are clicking on, thus potentially revealing confidential information or taking control of their computer while clicking on seemingly innocuous web pages.\n\nThe server didn't return an X-Frame-Options header which means that this website could be at risk of a clickjacking attack. The X-Frame-Options HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page in a <frame> or <iframe>. Sites can use this to avoid clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites.\n\nThis vulnerability affects Web Server.\n\nAs far as i know this data is enough to prove that your site is vulberable to Clickjacking..\naccording to OWASP its more than enough..\nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Clickjacking_(OWASP-CS-004)\n\nSolution\n\nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking_Defense_Cheat_Sheet\ncheck this out..here is the solution for that.\n\nRefer the attached screenshot for issue details.\n",
